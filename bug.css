The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, resulting in unexpected layout or styling issues.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` inside a flexbox container might not work as expected if the container's width isn't explicitly set.  Another issue might involve incorrect operator precedence within the `calc()` function or using incompatible units (e.g., mixing `px` and `em`).
